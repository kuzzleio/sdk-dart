# Http

The Http protocol can be used by an instance of the SDK to communicate with your Kuzzle server.

::: info
This protocol does not allow to use the [real-time notifications](/sdk/dart/3/essentials/realtime-notifications).

If you need real-time features, then you have to use the [WebSocket](/sdk/dart/3/protocols/websocket) protocol.
